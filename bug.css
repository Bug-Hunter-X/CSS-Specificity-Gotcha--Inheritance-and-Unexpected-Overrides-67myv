The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This should override both the div and p styles */
}

.special-class p {
  color: purple; /* This should override the div, p, and div p styles.  However, due to inheritance and specificity, it might not behave as expected */
}
```

In this example, the `.special-class p` selector inherits properties from both `div p` and `p`. Specificity rules will determine the outcome. Understanding how the browser resolves conflicting styles in this situation can be difficult.
